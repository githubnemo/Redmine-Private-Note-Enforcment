# Private Note Enforcement

Private comments were introduced in Redmine 2.2.0,
however there is no default setting for private notes yet.
While this may be implemented in the future, this plugin
provides a default setting for private notes, so that any
role which cannot create public notes automatically creates
private notes.

See http://www.redmine.org/issues/1554 for details.
